## Descripion
Responsive FAQ card made with css animated accordion. Simple JS script to control the accordion objects. Different styling for pc and mobile view.

## HTML
Basic structure with landmark elements. I had some issues with accordion and was rebuilding it several times.

## CSS
I like using flexbox whervever I can and that heps me making the layout responsive for various resolutions. I had to make the card in absolute dimensions (width) but the layout changes to adjust to mobile view (@media query).

I had issues with accordion that I rebuilt several times so it might not be too clean in css.

## JS
Easy script to control styling of accordion objects.
